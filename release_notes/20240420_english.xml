<content><string id="body">It's Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop's 7th birthday, which means it's time for our second annual mapping competition!

The theme this year is [b]Space Station[/b]. Create a standalone mission (of any type) that takes place on a space station or other large spaceship. Here are some ideas to get you started:

[list]
[*]A deathmatch mission with hazards that can be activated via panels scattered around the ship.
[*]An endless mission where civilians must be rescued from a derelict space station while keeping life support active.
[*]A mission where marines must fight their way through enemy soldiers to stop the ship's reactor from melting down.
[*]A mission where marines clear out a space station that is still being affected by the portal storms that preceded the seven hour war, full of warring Xen creatures.
[*]A mission where marines need to download critical data from computers on a space station that is actively falling apart.
[*]A mission where marines investigate the ruins of a space station that has reentered the atmosphere of a planet and crashed.
[/list]
